  <h1>Sustainable.css</h1>
  <p>A sustainable and good-enough CSS boilerplate that:
  <ol>
    <li>Leverages web browsers built-in aesthetics.</li>
    <li>It embraces semantic HTML.</li>
    <li>It focuses in basic styling, not layout.</li>
    <li>Is built with branding in mind so you can color pallette your site.</li>
    <li>Is built with sustainability in mind.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p>It is 2023, Web Browers are amazing at rendering and handling natively light-dark schemes. Let's built on that.</p>

  <h2>Yet another minimalistic CSS Framework?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I built sustainable.css because I usually do lots of simple websites that require two basic things:
  <ol>
    <li>Some kind of centering</li>
    <li>Customizing color pallettes.</li>
    <li>Support for dark/light schemes</li>
  </ol>
  I built this framework to help me with that. I hope it helps you too.
  </p>

  <h2>Is it for me?</h2>
  <p>Sustainable.css aims to be <strong>good enough</strong> at styling plain HTML. Perfect for MVPs and sites
    built on <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/hateoas/">HATEOAS</a>.</p>

  <p>It does not provide styling that you will probably change anyways (like headers font size and margins) nor layout
    system (it's 2023, you should be leveraging modern CSS).</p>

  <h2>Sustainability?</h2>
  <p>With sustainability I refer to several things:
  <ol>
    <li>It is just a few KB, Sustainable.css does not require lot of bandwith and energy to work.</li>
    <li>It will work as long as HTML and CSS work, with extremely low maintenaince.</li>
    <li>It is not hosted nor packaged with expensive pipelines or infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Web browsers spends lots of money on styling and rendering features. I build on top of that.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <h2>A Good Enough color pallette</h2>
  <p>
    Since I'm trying to delegate as much as possible to the browser defaults, I just choose a color that goes good with Black & White (<a href="https://dev.to/finnhvman/which-colors-look-good-on-black-and-white-2pe6">Which Colors Look Good on Black and White?</a>).
    This way I can leverage the browser's light-dark scheme, the user's preferences and I make sure that colors I choose are accesible.
  </p>
  <p>
    I might extend this as I explore and understand better minimalistic ideas to add color to a website.
  </p>
  <h2>Customization</h2>
  <p>
    Just add your own css file and override/extend whatever you want.
  </p>
  <p>
    So far only 2 variables are exposed:
  <ul>
    <li><code>--max-width</code> to control the width of the body </li>
    <li><code>--theme-color</code> to control the color of your theme.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
